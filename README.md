# Retro AI algorithms on the Commodore 64 and how they apply to modern AI

## Overview

This talk is based on the algorithms and code from the book [Artificial Intelligence Projects on the Commodore 64](https://archive.org/details/Artificial_Intelligence_Projects_for_the_Commodore_64_1985_TAB_Books) by Timothy O'Malley. Published in 1985.

## Notes

The assembly code was written to draw the chessboard fast, as it would take too long to wait for it for a presentation. 
The code was cross-assembled  https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/
