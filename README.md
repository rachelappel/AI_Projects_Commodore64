# Retro AI algorithms on the Commodore 64 and how they apply to modern AI

## Overview

This talk is based on the algorithms and code from the book [Artificial Intelligence Projects on the Commodore 64](https://archive.org/details/Artificial_Intelligence_Projects_for_the_Commodore_64_1985_TAB_Books) by Timothy O'Malley. Published in 1985.

## What's in the book
* The Towers of Hanoi; Recursive algorithm
* The Knight's Tour; Static path, precomputed data, expert system
* The Game of Nim; Combinatorial game theory, Minimax-like algorithm
* The Path through a Maze; Graph search algorithms (DFS, BFS), Backtracking
* Cellular Automaton; Rule-based systems, Discrete dynamical systems
* Training the Rat; Reinforcement learning, Trial and error
* First Bootstrap Program; Self modifying code
* Second Bootstrap Program; Self modifying code
* ELIZA-like Program; Pattern matching, Rule-based natural language processing
* Perfect Logic; Symbolic logic, inference engine
* Tic Tac Toe; Minimax-like algorithm
* Five-in-a-Row Game; Minimax, Heuristic evaluation
* Patterns in Numbers; Mathematical algorithms, Number theory
* Patterns in Strings; String matching algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp)
* A Word Processor; Text editing algorithms, Data structures for strings

## Notes

The assembly code was written to draw the chessboard fast and clear memory in tic-tac-toe, as it would take too long to wait for it for a presentation. 
The code was cross-assembled  https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/
Code was compiled with BASIC 64
